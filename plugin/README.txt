== Description ==

= Introduction =

[Aplazame](https://aplazame.com) is an instant credit payment method for online purchases that allows WooCommerce stores to sell more and increase average ticket values with a risk-free solution. A simple, secure and flexible over time payment method integrated at the ecommerce checkout. Once you activate and successfully integrate Aplazame in your site, you will be able to offer financing as a payment method to your customers.

WooCommerce stores can highlight our instant credit solution in activating our widget. This widget is a minimal and fully customizable credit simulator that will be displayed on both your product description and shopping cart views. It will allow the ecommerce to easily communicate the customer the possibility of financing her/his purchases at every step of the customer journey.
